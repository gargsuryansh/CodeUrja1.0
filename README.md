# AI-Powered News Verification System

## Overview
VeriFact-AI is a **Next.js + Flask**-based platform that verifies news authenticity using AI-powered **similarity search** and **web scraping**. The core feature is an **AI Agent** that searches the web for credible sources and compares them to the article in question.

Additionally, we've built a **browser extension** that allows users to verify news articles directly from any source they are reading. For images, we implemented multiple OCR models such as EasyOCR, TesseractOCR and our own Tensorflow model, but the best was Mistral OCR. Though its API is payment only, we decided to implement Gemini's 2.0 Flash model for very low cost as well as high efficiency,

## Tech Stack
### Frontend (Next.js)
- Built with **Next.js** (React framework) for fast rendering and SEO benefits.
- Uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- Integrates with the backend for real-time verification of news articles.
- Displays news credibility scores and source comparisons.

### Backend (Flask)
- **Flask** serves as the backend API.
- Scrapes and processes real-time news from **credible sources**.
- Uses **vector-based similarity search** to compare news articles.
- Leverages **AI-based NLP models** for content analysis.

### AI Agent & Similarity Search
- AI Agent fetches and evaluates multiple news sources to cross-check facts.
- Uses **embedding models** (e.g., OpenAI, Sentence Transformers) for similarity detection.
- Filters out misinformation and ranks sources based on credibility.

### Browser Extension
- The **Chrome Extension** allows users to verify news instantly.
- It scans the current article and provides real-time authenticity predictions.
- Uses the same AI model as the platform for consistency.


## How It Works
1. **User inputs or visits a news article.**
2. **Backend scrapes related news sources.**
3. **AI Agent analyzes and compares the information.**
4. **Similarity search determines factual accuracy.**
5. **Users get a credibility score & source comparisons.**
