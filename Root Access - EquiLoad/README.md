## EquiLoad - A Smart Load Balancer  
EquiLoad is an intelligent, AI-assisted load balancer that optimizes traffic distribution across backend servers. Users can configure their backend servers, select from different load-balancing algorithms, and even receive AI recommendations based on their needs. Additionally, a built-in machine learning model predicts the best server based on CPU usage, memory, active connections, and response time.  

## Features  
- *Custom Backend Configuration*: Users can input their backend server URLs.  
- *Very Easy Onboarding*: Very convenient for beginners.  
- *Algorithm Selection*: Choose from multiple load-balancing algorithms.  
- *AI Assistance*: If unsure about an algorithm, users can consult AI for recommendations.  
- *ML-Based Prediction*: The system intelligently assigns requests using a machine learning model that considers:  
  - CPU Usage  
  - Memory Consumption  
  - Active Connections  
  - Response Time  

## Usage  
1. Enter your backend server URLs.  
2. Select a load-balancing algorithm or ask AI for guidance.  
3. Enable ML-based prediction for automated decision-making.  
4. Monitor server performance and request distribution.  

## Load Balancing Algorithms Supported  
- *Round Robin*: Distributes requests sequentially.  
- *Least Connections*: Directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.  
- *IP Hashing*: Routes requests based on the client's IP address to maintain session persistence.  
- *AI-Assisted Recommendation*: Suggests the best algorithm based on workload.
